## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

- During this project, I learned how to effectively integrate APIs into a Next.js application, manage state with React hooks, and improve UI/UX using TailwindCSS for styling.
- Handling nested routing for detailed country information and integrating context providers for theme management were also key takeaways.

### Continued development

 - In future projects, I plan to continue refining my skills in API integration, particularly with complex data structures and pagination. I also aim to enhance my knowledge of TypeScript to further strengthen type safety throughout my applications.

### Useful resources

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/) - This helped me for implementing dynamic routing.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for dark mode styles in application.
